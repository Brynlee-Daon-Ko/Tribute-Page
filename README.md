# Tribute Page

This is a tribute page for Yu Gwan-sun, built for the second certification project on freeCodeCamp.

## Description

This was my first certification project for the Responsive Web Design certificate on freeCodeCamp. The task was to build a tribute page using HTML and CSS.

I decided to make a tribute page for Yu Gwan-sun because I'm Korean and she was one of the bravest independence activists in Korea during the Japanese colonial period. So, I wanted to honor her by choosing her as the person for whom I create a tribute page.
